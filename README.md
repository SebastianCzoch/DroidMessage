# DroidMessage

Apple have a great application `Messages` which unfortunatley is not working with the Andoird os. After migration from the iOS device to the Andoird that was a huge problem to me.
This is simple application which include [Android Messages for Web](https://messages.android.com) in a small aplication with tray icon, notifications.

This application was made for my personal usage. Tested only on MacOS High Sierra 

### Development Scripts

```bash
# run application in development mode
yarn dev

# compile source code and create webpack output
yarn compile

# `yarn compile` & create build with electron-builder
yarn dist

# `yarn compile` & create unpacked build with electron-builder
yarn dist:dir
```
